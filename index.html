        <br/>I was born in Maryland, and moved down to Florida when I was in High School. I have worked for the three biggest theme parks
        in Orlando over the course of eight years. I have made many mistakes, and learned many lessons in my career in the
        theme parks. I have built friendships that will never die, and even found love in a place I would have never guessed.
        I closed the book on my journey though the workplaces of Walt Disney World, Universal, and SeaWorld, and soon I open
        my next book into the world of Technology and Software Engineering.
        <br/> I have always loved technology, video games, and the internet. One day I decided to learn how to program a bit,
        and followed a few tutorials. Another day I took an 'Intro to C' class in college. I have gone through countless
        hours of teaching myself how to program, making games in Unity, building simple websites, and eventually signing
        up for a school that changed my life. Finally, I have enough knowledge to pursue my dreams, and go even beyond that.
        I am so excited to start looking for a company and start my next chapter!
        <br/> A few of my hobbies include playing video games, watching anime and tv shows, weightlifting, running, lounging at
        my favorite cafes or restaraunts with my friends, and spending time with my girlfriend whenever our schedules line
        up.
